There has been an increase in the false means being adopted by contesting parties to influence the citizens to vote for them.
They make false commitments to solicit votes from the people.
There are a number of malpractices being adopted these days which include electoral fraud, tampering with the EVMs etc.


Ideas intended to be implemented:
->To develop a blockchain by which every citizen gets to know whom he or she has voted for ensuring that confidentiality is maintained by means of encryption.
->To include the name of the person who has turned 18 years of age automatically in the voter list.
->To make the EVMs secure such that they are not hacked.
